# Application TODO List
	[?] Implement the rest of the python configuration options
	[ ] Make a neon color scheme
	[ ] Make the window exit button rendering dynamic
	[ ] Option to enable/disable auto-loading of output file dump
	[ ] Close running program instances when the application is exiting
	
	[ ] Fix the format string functions to choose to split open and close symbols differently
	[ ] Paste from clipboard
	[ ] Change the status message layout so it pops up as an overlay with formatted text rendering so the whole message always fits nicely
	[ ] Add a string data stack for all input lines to get added to
	[ ] Get rid of the UI Handler since we probably won't ever need movable/modular windows. Also function pointer remapping is stupid looking
	[ ] Add checking for COM port errors and whether or not we are still connected
	[ ] Option to enable timestamps and line color characters when saving to file
	[ ] Fade out the status message during the last second. (Requires more accurate timing information)
	[ ] Custom regular expression effects, variable number of regular expressions
	[ ] Text cursor maintains when dragging out of text area
	[ ] Add better support for default configuration options that are simply overwritten by the user defined ones. Can we provide an example file or something? Maybe leave everything commented out and let them uncomment things?
	[?] Combine the configuration files into one file?
	[ ] Add a function that writes to a single option in the configuration file so we can have program written configuration options?
	[ ] Create the configuration files again if they are found to be missing on startup?
	[ ] Save window position and size when closing to configuration options. Pass these to windows when we create the window at startup
	[ ] Add the actual COM# below the assigned name in the COM port menu
	[ ] Fix console window opening with python 2?
	[ ] Keep old configuration options if new configuration file is unparsable (only on reload)
	[ ] Add an option to enable commands that can be sent from the python script and interpreted by ConstPort to provide extra functionality

	[-] Add a platform layer function to set the TempArena so we can add functions that push onto Temporary Memory when we call them NOTE: Probably will just pass memory arenas when arenas are needed, we can pass TempArena really easily if we want the function to allocate it on the temporary arena)
	[-] String manipulation functions using the TemporaryArena NOTE: Not many that I actually want :P Now a mylib file that has helpful string manipulation function might be nice
	[X] Ability to draw circles with the simpleShader
